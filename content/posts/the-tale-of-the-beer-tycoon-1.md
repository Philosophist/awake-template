# The Tale of The Beer Tycoon



Once there was a brewer named Dave who created a brew.



It was a beer to itself. Nothing compared as he knew.



It was strong, hoppy, malty, and sweet.



It paired well with anything you wanted to eat.



\~\~\~\~



Dave determined it was his favorite beer,



convinced it was better than any.



So he set off to build a small business.



He invested everything for the taste buds of the many.



\~\~\~\~



Over time, Dave discovered



He had more than a talent for craft.



He had business savvy to spare,



As his large competitors laughed.



\~\~\~\~



Dave’s business was booming,



In almost no time, it seemed.



Investors begged to give him fortunes,



Just to buy him out clean.



\~\~\~\~



Dave turned to them and said, "No thank you.



I don’t know how my beer truly fares in your view.



The joy of the craft is that this beer stands alone.



I will build my own fortune and buy my own throne."



\~\~\~\~



Dave built a brewing empire from the ground up in his name.



His business expanded and earned him world fame.



In business, his tactics were ambitious.



Even cutthroat to boot.



He built a great fortune, bought a comfortable throne,



And he wore a nice suit.



\~\~\~\~



Beer lovers across the globe admired him.



To his fans, he was friendly.



He sponsored beer tastings, competitions,



And conventions aplenty.



\~\~\~\~



Amidst all of his virtues,



Dave’s integrity was strong.



If his beer was not the best,



He would to know if he was wrong.



\~\~\~\~



One day, Dave met a brewer named James,



With a taste of new drink.



“I didn’t forget my keys for nothing!,”



Dave said with a wink.



\~\~\~\~



Dave gave it a taste…



And was amazed by the flavor!



Something even better than his own brew?



This he had to savor.



\~\~\~\~



“How much do you want for it?,”



Dave said with a gasp.



James replied, "I’m honored truly,



But afraid I must pass.



\~\~\~\~



The value of this beer will stand on it’s own.



Your integrity inspired me, to invest in it alone."



Dave, The Beer Tycoon, understood this too well.



He wished James, “Good luck!” and plotted James’ business to fail.



\~\~\~\~



Dave, The Beer Tycoon, stuck to his tactics,



To maintain what he was after.



“’Tis a shame,” he thought,



“about that talented crafter.”



\~\~\~\~



James’ beer had failed the market,



With James none the wiser.



Dave saw it as just business,



Not the business of a miser.



\~\~\~\~



To the end of his days, Dave The Beer Tycoon lived on with good cheer.



He remained at the top, with a fortune and throne,



Drinking his second favorite beer.

Thanks for reading! Let me know in the comments below what you think! The hope is that I can turn this story into a physical book that would be a simple coffee table print and styled like a children’s book. If you like it, consider joining the newsletter for updates on when I launch a Patreon page for the blog and Kickstarter page for the publishing campaign.





I will need to hire an artist to do the drawings before I launch a Kickstarter, so if you can donate in the future or if you can make some contributions of fan art and share ideas, that would be greatly appreciated.
